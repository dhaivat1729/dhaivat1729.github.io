I am a visiting researcher at [Montreal Institute For Learning Algorithms (MILA)](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by [Prof. Liam Paull](http://liampaull.ca/). I finished my undergraduation from [Birla institute of technology and science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) in Electronics and instrumentation in 2016. I was a Masters by research student at [Robotics research center, IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/). 

During my masters, I extensively worked on problems like road boundary/curb detection and intersection localization using graphical models and Deep learning. For my thesis, I worked on solving stochastic control sequence problem in a Model Predictive control framework. I have a diverse set of interests, ranging from [Deep learning](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513696/deep-learning/), [reinforcement learning](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603501/10-breakthrough-technologies-2017-reinforcement-learning/), [Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics) and [Optimal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control). 

When I am not doing research, I am probably doing a course on history or debating politics with someone.
