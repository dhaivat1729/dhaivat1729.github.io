I am a visiting researcher at Montreal Institute For Learning Algorithms (MILA), advised by Dr. Liam Paull. I finished my undergraduation from [Birla institute of technology and science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) in Electronics and instrumentation in 2016. I was a Masters by research student at [Robotics research center, IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/).

I work in the areas of Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. During my undergrad, I worked in computer vision and deep learning for robotics. The culture at Mila made me delve deep into various topics like theory of Reinforcement Learning, biologically plausible learning algorithms, generative models etc.. 

When I am not doing research, I play chess (I recently became an International Master and won many International medals when I was a kid) and read physics
